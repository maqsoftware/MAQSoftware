												<p class="lead mb-20">Seeking a data-driven engineer with in-depth understanding of business processes.</p>
												<p><strong>Engineering Culture</strong></p>
												<p>We foster a strong engineering culture with a can-do attitude. All our key managers come from excellent educational backgrounds and have significant experience growing a company and mentoring software engineers. Due to our smaller size, we adopt the latest technologies and computing trends ahead of the larger industry players. As a part of the company’s globally distributed engineering team, our engineers gain exposure to the latest software engineering practices and fast development cycles.</p>
												<p>Our developers routinely work on challenging technical problems that utilize the latest technologies for fast-paced software delivery.</p>
												<p><strong>Project examples include:</strong></p>
												<ul>
													<li>Built a supervised machine learning model for one of our clients to forecast the impact of retail sales on their overall revenue. We collected data from existing customer relationship management (CRM) and sales systems. We created a forecasting model in Azure Databricks using existing and custom linear regression to process the collected data. To reduce forecast runtime and achieve near real-time analysis, we modified the existing R libraries to SparkR. The increased insight helped our client to proactively focus on retailers with higher sales impact.</li>
													<li>One of our clients, a multinational technology company, organizes an annual internal expo with numerous showcase events. Thousands of employees attend the events and the manual process of tracking attendance, sending acknowledgments, and receiving feedback was time consuming. To automate the process, we built a check-in app that uses mobile devices’ camera to capture the identification badge of each participant. The captured images are stored in an Azure Blob. An Azure logic app reads the image content utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) API to update attendance records. After the event, notifications are sent to attendees via Teams to complete a feedback survey using a Flow Bot. The Feedback App reports the survey responses to determine the Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score of the event.</li>
													<li>For another client with high volume data, we developed and implemented a hybrid data processing solution using Azure Stream Analytics and Azure Databricks to reduce data refresh time from 3 hours to less than 30 minutes. We sourced data from the Azure Event Hub, where refreshes originate. Refreshes are captured through stream analytics and the updated data is pushed to Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS). The data is processed in ADLS, then pushed to Power BI for reporting.  </li>
												</ul><br>
												<p><strong>Job Responsibilities:</strong></p>
												<p><strong>Analyze existing systems (30%)</strong></p>
												<ul>

													<li>Analyze existing system structures to provide solutions to improve computer systems to use cloud-based systems and services.</li>

Develop and maintain systems documentation such as design specifications, user manuals, technical manuals, descriptions of application operations, and methodology documentation.</li>
													<li>Analyze feasibility using commercially available software systems (e.g. Microsoft Azure versus Amazon Web Services) and reporting systems (e.g. Power BI versus Tableau).</li>
												</ul><br>
