                                            and more frequently. However, it also requires more robust testing and
                                            monitoring processes to ensure that issues are caught and addressed quickly.

                                    <p class="text-large">Incorporate security testing into the CI/CD pipeline. This
                                        approach enables you to test and detect security vulnerabilities early in the
                                        development process. You can identify potential security threats and risks by
                                        conducting threat modeling at the beginning of projects.</p>
                                    <p class="text-large">Secure Configuration Management (SCM) ensures that all

                                        managing access controls, encryption keys, and other security-related settings.

                                    <p class="text-large">Continuous monitoring is the key to ensuring that the software
                                        is working as expected. You can continuously monitor the software's performance
                                        and progress using burn-down and burn-up charts. These charts provide visual
                                        representations of the work completed and the work remaining—enabling effective
                                        tracking and monitoring.</p>
                                    <p class="text-large">Setting up dashboards in Azure DevOps is another option. Use

                                        delivering software. To achieve this, teams must focus on building software that
                                        meets or exceeds expected standards for functionality, usability, reliability,
                                        and security.</p>
                                    <p class="text-large">By emphasizing quality, teams ensure that the software
