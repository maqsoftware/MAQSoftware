                                        it’s more important now than ever to plan for the worst-case scenario. The Zero
                                        Trust model operates on the principle of “never trust, always verify.” It
                                        assumes the corporate firewall has already been breached and verifies each
                                        request that comes through as if it was coming from an uncontrolled network.

                                        Azure virtual machines (VMs). Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP - 3389) and the
                                        Secure Shell (SSH - 22) protocol are commonly used management ports that enable
                                        admins to manage VMs from remote locations. However, using these protocols over
                                        the internet enables attackers to use brute force techniques to gain access to
                                        VMs. For example, attackers have been known to scan public cloud IP ranges for
                                        known vulnerabilities and common passwords.</p>
                                    <p class="text-large">Mitigate the risk by restricting access to management ports

                                    <p class="text-large">IP restrictions enable you to define which IP addresses can
                                        access your service. Whitelisting IP addresses prevents unwanted or unauthorized
                                        machines from accessing the service. The “allow” list can include individual IP
                                        addresses or a range of IP addresses defined by a subnet mask. This gives you
                                        close control over who can access your cloud data. Don’t assign allow rules with
                                        broad ranges (for example, “allow 0.0.0.0 through 255.255.255.255”). </p>
                                    <p class="text-large">Even when whitelisting IP address, protect your virtual
                                        network using Azure Firewall. On top of limiting access to IP ranges, restrict
                                        access to limited ports.</p>

                                    <p class="text-large">Most Azure managed disks are automatically encrypted via
                                        server-side encryption (SSE) with a platform-managed key (PMK). For OS and data
                                        disks, you should also enable Azure Disk Encryption (ADE). This way, your data
                                        has two levels of protection. ADE helps protect and safeguard your data by using
                                        Azure Key Vault to control and manage encryption keys and secrets. With only SSE
                                        enabled, downloaded VHD files will be decrypted and can be used to create a new
                                        VM. With both SSE and ADE enabled, users cannot use downloaded VHD files to
                                        create a new VM unless provided the decryption key.</p>

                                        business and security operations. Any misconfiguration or lapse in app hygiene
                                        not only increases downtime for end users, but actually compromises the entire
                                        system. To ensure your Azure AD app registrations are secure, implement the
                                        following practices:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li class="text-large">Use least privileged access. Grant only the minimum set
                                            of permissions required for end users to perform the required tasks in an
                                            application, service, or system. </li>
                                        <li class="text-large">Clearly define app registration credentials. Credentials
                                            are key when using app registrations as a confidential client. If your app
                                            registration is used only as a Public Client App (allows users to sign in
                                            using a public endpoint), ensure that you don't have any credentials on your
                                            application object. </li>
                                        <li class="text-large">Minimize app ownership. Once a quarter, run through the
                                            app owners list to ensure owners are still part of the organization. </li>

                                        authentication, adds a secondary layer of security to your systems. Azure AD MFA
                                        verifies user identities via phone call, text message, or mobile app
                                        notification. Azure AD MFA replaces outdated username and password
                                        authentication, restricting unauthorized access. Because Azure AD MFA requires
                                        access to a user’s phone, the user’s data and applications are protected even if
                                        the user’s password is compromised. Organizations that do not add this extra
