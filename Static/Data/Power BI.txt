    <p class="DataSubContent">Microsoft Power BI and Amazon QuickSight are rapidly disrupting the visual insights landscape.</p>
	<p class="DataSubContent">Microsoft Power BI enables you to find and visualize data, share discoveries, and collaborate in intuitive new ways. Power BI transforms your company's data into rich visuals for you to collect and organize so you can focus on what matters to you.</p>
	<p class="DataSubContent">Amazon QuickSight, along similar lines, is a service that makes it easy to build visualizations, perform ad-hoc analysis, and quickly get business insights from data. Amazon QuickSight uses a new, Super-fast, Parallel, In-memory Calculation Engine ("SPICE") to perform advanced calculations and render visualizations rapidly.</p>

	<p class="Datatagline SemiBold m30 Color58585a">Preferred Partner for Power BI</p>
	<p class="DataSubContent">We use Power BI in solutions that provide insights into large datasets. We reduced customer report development time by using Power BI instead of traditional custom techniques. We partner with the Power BI development team to test and validate the technology with large and complex datasets. As one of the preferred partners for Power BI, we have released multiple <a class="SliderArrow BackLink viLinks" href="https://app.powerbi.com/visuals" target="_blank">Power BI components</a>, including:</p>
    <ul class="MarginTop5 CircleBullets">

By allowing you to include multiple data points, the component provides the ability to illustrate trend details, such as monthly or year-to-date completion rates. The pointer notes targets and the colored bar shows the current progress toward those goals.</li>
        <li><a class="SliderArrow BackLink viLinks" href="https://app.powerbi.com/visuals/show/HorizontalFunnel1449177164235" target="_blank">Horizontal Funnel</a>: Horizontal Funnel allows you to visualize a customizable primary measure as colored bars. Use this component to display a number of metric types, such as sales stages, time or geographic locations. A second customizable value is displayed beneath the colored bars. This feature provides you the ability to track an additional metric against your primary measure. The component includes the option to create a tool tip, which you may tailor to your specific needs.</li>
    </ul>
