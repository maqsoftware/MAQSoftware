							<p class="text-large">CertyFAST by MAQ Software is a <a
									href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-external-tools"
									target="_blank">Power BI External Tool </a>designed to improve the development and review process of Power BI models and reports. This tool helps team members to easily identify common mistakes in the Power BI model and assists developers in formatting DAX measures used in the report. Additionally, it aids in documenting the model with a single click, easing the process of identifying the fields used in various visuals.</p>
							<p class="text-large">With the increasing adoption of Power BI and the trend towards self-serve reporting, many organizations are dealing with large enterprise models with multiple tables and measures. This scale can make it challenging for developers or reviewers to perform comprehensive checks for the entire model, potentially leading to sub-optimal deliverables. CertyFAST by MAQ Software addresses this challenge by enabling basic checks with a single click, highlighting gaps in the overall model against industry best practices.</p>

							<h2>Business Scenario</h2>
							<p class="text-large">Fortune 500 companies heavily rely on Power BI to generate and analyze extensive amounts of data for data-driven decision-making. However, as the adoption of Power BI grows, organizations face a range of challenges related to governance, user experience, report performance, brand consistency, use of custom components, and solution architecture. These challenges necessitate tools that can help developers and reviewers ensure quality and adherence to standards in Power BI solutions.</p>
							<h3>Existing Process adopted by all our customers:</h3>
							<p class="text-large">Currently, developers often use multiple external tools to cover various aspects of the development stage. Despite this, they still need to manually analyze/sanity check large models to identify deviations from best practices.
