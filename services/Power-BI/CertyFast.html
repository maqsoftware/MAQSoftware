								<b>CertyFAST </b>by MAQ Software is a tool designed to improve the development and review process of Power BI models and reports. This tool helps team members easily identify common mistakes in the Power BI model and assists developers in formatting DAX measures used in the report. Additionally, it assists in documenting the model with a single click, simplifying the process of identifying the fields used in various visuals and ensuring the reports adhere to organizational best practices.
							
							<h2>About CertyFAST</h2>
							<p class="text-large">
								With the increasing adoption of Power BI and the trend towards self-serve reporting, many organizations are dealing with large enterprise models with multiple tables and measures. This scale can make it challenging for developers or reviewers to perform comprehensive checks for the entire model, potentially leading to sub-optimal deliverables.							
							</p>
							<p class="text-large">
								As Power BI grows in use, organizations also face challenges related to governance, user experience, report performance, brand consistency, use of custom components, and solution architecture. CertyFAST by MAQ Software addresses these issues by enabling basic checks with a single click, highlighting gaps in the overall model against industry best practices and ensuring quality and adherence to standards in Power BI solutions.
							</p>

							<h3>Existing process adopted by our customers</h3>
							<p class="text-large">
								Currently, developers often use multiple external tools to cover various aspects of the development stage. Despite this, they still need to manually analyze/sanity check large models to identify deviations from best practices. There is lack of a comprehensive tool that addresses both the analysis of the Power BI data model and report visualization.
							</p>



							<h3>Drawbacks of implementing uncertified reports</h3>
							<ul class="text-large">
								<li>
									<b>Experience performance degradation:</b>
									
									Errors can lead to slow-loading reports, consuming more resources and affecting the user experience.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Risk misguided decision making:</b>

									Inaccurate reports misguide decision-making and reduce stakeholder trust in data reliability.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Increase maintenance overhead:</b>
									
									Frequent fixes and updates increase maintenance efforts, diverting focus from development.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Raise security concerns:</b>
									
									Improperly managed reports risk exposing sensitive data and violating access controls.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Face compliance risks: </b>
									
									Non-compliance with best practices may result in audit failures and legal repercussions.
								</li>
							</ul>
